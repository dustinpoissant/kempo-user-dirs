  Local/CI test-database setup only — this extension has no migrations of its own in production.
  Its tables are created the real way, via createTablesFromSchema at install time, which the
  data-layer suite exercises directly. This file exists so `npx drizzle-kit push` can stand up a
  throwaway database holding kempo's core tables, kempo-files' (the library this builds on) and
  this extension's own.

  No dotenv here on purpose: nothing in this repo's own runtime loads .env either. DATABASE_URL
  needs to be a real environment variable — export it, or prefix the command.
